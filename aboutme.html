        My name is Duane Andrei James Tugas. I am 14 years old. I am a student from the Philippine Science High School - Southern Mindanao Campus. <br>
        I love playing and watching sports such as volleyball and basketball. I also love playing video games and watching professional matches. <br>
        Currently, the video game I play is Valorant, a first person shooter game developed by Riot Games. I also have a squad, which was made by me and my friends both outside and inside of Pisay. <br>  
        I am also Math Olympiad and have represented the Philippines
        in various competitions, both online and offline, for 6 years. <br>
        When I grow older, I want to become a doctor, teacher, researcher, and more (even professional gamer). <br>
        I hope this school year is gonna be great...I will be okay. Definitely okay
